## Concept

The goal is to provide individual web pages with short coding examples. The recipes here follow the example of https://threejs.org/examples/.

Each example is a standalone HTML file that contains all the CSS and JavaScript - apart from library files - needed to run the example.

### Cookbook Meaning

* http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/70799/meaning-of-cookbook-in-title-of-instructional-book
> The point that is only implicit in the answer is that a cookbook does not try to be complete (like a reference manual), or to teach you the system or language (like a tutorial): it takes a number of particular problems or patterns which the author believes are common, and shows you how to solve those. It may not even explain the solutions (though it may).

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookbook#Usage_outside_the_world_of_food 
> The term cookbook is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to any book containing a straightforward set of already tried and tested "recipes" or instructions for a specific field or activity, presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results. Examples include a set of circuit designs in electronics, a book of magic spells, or The Anarchist Cookbook, a set of instructions on destruction and living outside the law. O'Reilly Media publishes a series of books about computer programming named the Cookbook series, and each of these books contain hundreds of ready to use, cut and paste examples to solve a specific problem in a single programming language.

* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Coding_Cookbook
> This book features all kinds of short coding samples, often called code snippets. It is not a reference for any specific coding language, or a command reference.

> cookbooks aren't really intended to be read straight through as learning tools. They're designed to be used when you run into a specific problem, or you wonder "what's a good way to do X in this language?"
