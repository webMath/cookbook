## Concept

### Issue / The problem to be solved

Generating smooth meshes from a limited number of controls points is tricky.

[Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline ) is a mathematical model commonly used in computer graphics for generating and representing curves and surfaces. NURBS often offer good solutions for this type of charting.

Three.js has a [NURBS plugin]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/js/curves )

This is a preliminary example just to get going. It would be great to have some sample data to graph.


### Mission

* Simple ways of generating complex curves
* Useful for charts
* Useful for 3D modeling

### Vision

* One day: create a routine that creates a smooth transition between two NURBS surfaces

## To DO

* Use look-up table: https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_geometry_colors_lookuptable
* Add vertex color according to rules
* Display location of control points
* User control over opacity and other material characteristics
* Multiple layer charts
* Display vertex and face normals
* Heads up display with details regarding current location
